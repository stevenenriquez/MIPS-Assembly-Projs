# MIPS-Assembly-Projs README

MIPS Assembly Projects for a course at NAU. Written in Assembly.

I used MARS (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator) to write/run/test the code.
You can find MARS here: (http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/mars/)

## Projects
* **bubble_sort.asm** - Bubble sort. (_Version 1_)
* **bubble_proj2.asm** - Bubble sort. Cleaner. (_Version 2_)
* **bubble_sort_redux.asm** - Bubble sort with multiple functions. Cleanest version. (_Version 3_)
* **cents.asm** - User inputs amount of cents (ex: 100c). Program outputs that amount in the least number of each denomination of cents (ex: 4 quarters).
* **division.asm** - User inputs 2 integers (x and y respectively). Program outputs x / y and x mod y.
* **rps.asm** - Rock, Paper, Scissors Game.
